This folder needs to contain the compiled matlab code used by ProducerConsumer

Files: libmatrix.ctf, libmatrix.dll

libmatrix_mcr will autmatically be generated the first time these files are used.
If you replace the .ct and .dll files, make sure you delete libmatrix_mcr too, so that
a fresh libmatrix_mcr that corresponds to the new files will get generated.
