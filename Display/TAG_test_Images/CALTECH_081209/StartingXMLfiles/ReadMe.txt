target baseball glove images.  This XML still exists as:
Caltech256_Training_pilotExpTrainXML_hadthehardtrainingtargets.xml (which only
had baseball glove image 100 removed)

and

Copy of Caltech256_Training.xml which had all the baseball glove images

When we got to the real experiments other hard images (63 and 13) were removed
from the training as well.  That file is:

Caltech256_Training.xml
